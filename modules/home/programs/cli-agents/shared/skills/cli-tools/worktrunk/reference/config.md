# wt config

Manage user & project configs. Includes shell integration, hooks, and saved state.

## Examples

Install shell integration (required for directory switching):

```console
$ wt config shell install
```

Create user config file with documented examples:

```console
$ wt config create
```

Create project config file (`.config/wt.toml`) for hooks:

```console
$ wt config create --project
```

Show current configuration and file locations:

```console
$ wt config show
```

## Configuration files

| File | Location | Contains | Committed & shared |
|------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| **User config** | `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` | Worktree path template, LLM commit configs, etc | ✗ |
| **Project config** | `.config/wt.toml` | Project hooks, dev server URL | ✓ |

Organizations can deploy a system-wide config file for shared defaults — run `wt config show` for the platform-specific location.

**User config** — personal preferences:

```toml
# ~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml
worktree-path = ".worktrees/{{ branch | sanitize }}"

[commit.generation]
command = "MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0 claude -p --no-session-persistence --model=haiku --tools='' --safe-mode --setting-sources='user' --system-prompt=''"
```

**Project config** — shared team settings:

```toml
# .config/wt.toml
[pre-start]
deps = "npm ci"

[pre-merge]
test = "npm test"
```

<!-- USER_CONFIG_START -->
# User Configuration

Create with `wt config create`. Values shown are defaults unless noted otherwise.

Location:

- macOS/Linux: `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` if set)
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\worktrunk\config.toml`

## Worktree path template

Controls where new worktrees are created.

**Available template variables:**

- `{{ repo_path }}` — absolute path to the repository root (e.g., `/Users/me/code/myproject`. Or for bare repos, the bare directory itself)
- `{{ repo }}` — repository directory name (e.g., `myproject`)
- `{{ owner }}` — primary remote owner path (may include subgroups like `group/subgroup`)
- `{{ remote_repo }}` — repository name in the primary remote URL, without `.git` (e.g., `myproject`); differs from `{{ repo }}`, the directory on disk, when a clone was renamed
- `{{ branch }}` — raw branch name (e.g., `feature/auth`)
- `{{ branch | sanitize }}` — filesystem-safe: `/` and `\` become `-` (e.g., `feature-auth`)
- `{{ branch | sanitize_db }}` — database-safe: lowercase, underscores, hash suffix (e.g., `feature_auth_x7k`)
- `{{ branch | codename(2) }}` — deterministic friendly name from a ~1.26M-combo pool (e.g., `malleable-opah`)

This is a smaller set than [the variables hooks and aliases get](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#template-variables).

**Examples** for repo at `~/code/myproject`, branch `feature/auth`:

Default — sibling directory (`~/code/myproject.feature-auth`):

```toml
worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/../{{ repo }}.{{ branch | sanitize }}"
```

Inside the repository (`~/code/myproject/.worktrees/feature-auth`):

```toml
worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/.worktrees/{{ branch | sanitize }}"
```

Friendly branch-derived names (`~/code/myproject.malleable-opah`):

```toml
worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/../{{ repo }}.{{ branch | codename(2) }}"
```

Friendly names with branch identity in a parent directory (`~/code/worktrees/feature-auth/malleable-opah`):

```toml
worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/../worktrees/{{ branch | sanitize }}/{{ branch | codename(2) }}"
```

Centralized worktrees directory (`~/worktrees/myproject/feature-auth`):

```toml
worktree-path = "~/worktrees/{{ repo }}/{{ branch | sanitize }}"
```

By remote owner path (`~/development/max-sixty/myproject/feature/auth`):

```toml
worktree-path = "~/development/{{ owner }}/{{ repo }}/{{ branch }}"
```

Bare repository (`~/code/myproject/feature-auth`):

```toml
worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/../{{ branch | sanitize }}"
```

`~` expands to the home directory. Relative paths resolve from `repo_path`.

## LLM commit messages

Generate commit messages automatically during merge. Requires an external CLI tool.

### Claude Code

[commit.generation]
command = "MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0 claude -p --no-session-persistence --model=haiku --tools='' --safe-mode --setting-sources='user' --system-prompt=''"
```

### Codex

```toml
[commit.generation]
command = "codex exec -m gpt-5.6-luna -c model_reasoning_effort='low' -c system_prompt='' --sandbox=read-only --json - | jq -sr '[.[] | select(.item.type? == \"agent_message\")] | last.item.text'"
```

### OpenCode

```toml
[commit.generation]
command = "opencode run -m anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5 --variant fast"
```

### llm

command = "aichat -m claude:claude-haiku-4.5"
```

See [LLM commits docs](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/) for setup and [Custom prompt templates](#custom-prompt-templates) for template customization.

## Command config

### List

Persistent flag values for `wt list`. Override on command line as needed.

```toml
[list]
summary = false    # Enable LLM branch summaries (requires [commit.generation])

full = false       # Show CI status and LLM summaries (--full)
branches = false   # Include branches without worktrees (--branches)
remotes = false    # Include remote-only branches (--remotes)

json-schema = 2    # JSON output schema: 2 (envelope) or 1 (bare array, the current default); unset emits 1 with a warning

columns = ["branch", "status", "ci", "path"]   # Columns to show, in order — built-ins or custom headers (omit for the default set)

timeout-ms = 0     # Wall-clock budget for the entire collect phase; 0 disables
```

`columns` selects and orders the columns the `wt list` table and the `wt switch`
picker render; `--format json` ignores it and always emits every field. Omit it
for the default set. It is meant to drive a per-invocation
[alias](https://worktrunk.dev/extending/#aliases) (`wt --config-set 'list.columns=[…]' list`),
giving a named view without disturbing the default `wt list`. A static setting
works but pins one layout over a table that otherwise adapts to `--full` and
terminal width.

Valid built-in names:

- `branch` — The branch name
- `status` — Git status symbols, plus any user-defined status
- `working-diff` — Uncommitted line changes against `HEAD`, including untracked files (header `HEAD±`)
- `ahead-behind` — Commits ahead of and behind the default branch (header `main↕`)
- `branch-diff` — Line changes against the default branch (header `main…±`)
- `summary` — An LLM-generated summary of the branch
- `upstream` — Commits ahead of and behind the upstream tracking branch (header `Remote⇅`)
- `ci` — CI status of the head commit
- `path` — The worktree's path
- `url` — Dev-server URL from the `[list] url` template
- `commit` — The head commit's short hash
- `age` — Time since the last commit
- `message` — The head commit's subject

A selection mixes built-ins with [custom columns](#custom-columns), each named
by its `[list.custom-columns]` header (`columns = ["branch", "Ticket", "ci"]`),
and is exhaustive: only the listed columns render. Omit `columns` to keep the
default set, where custom columns append automatically. A built-in name wins a
header collision; the gutter type indicator always shows.

Listing a column forces it on, space permitting: `ci` shows without `--full`,
since `--full` only bundles columns into the default table rather than gating a
named one. A column whose data source is missing still stays hidden — `summary`
needs an LLM command (`[commit.generation]`), `url` needs a `[list] url`
template — since listing can't supply the data.

#### Custom columns [experimental]

Custom columns add per-branch context to the `wt list` table. Each
`[list.custom-columns]` entry is a column: the key is the header, the template
renders each row's cell.

```toml
[list.custom-columns.Ticket]
template = "{{ vars.ticket }}"   # Required; the result is the cell text
width = 20                       # Optional max display width (default: 40)
priority = 9                     # Optional drop order when the terminal narrows;
                                 # lower = kept longer (default: 9, the URL band)
```

Templates may reference `{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree_path }}`,
`{{ worktree_name }}` (empty for branch-only rows), and two per-branch
namespaces:

- `{{ vars.* }}` — values stored with
  [`wt config state vars set`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-vars).
- `{{ git.branch.* }}` — the branch's own git config under `branch.<name>.*`,
  read straight from `git config` (e.g. `{{ git.branch.jira }}` for a key you
  set yourself, or the git-native `description`). Git lowercases config variable
  names, so `branch.<name>.nvciShelf` reads as `{{ git.branch.nvcishelf }}`.

All standard filters work (`sanitize`, `hash_port`, `codename`, …). A row
where the template renders empty (e.g. a branch without the key) shows an
empty cell; a column that is empty for every row is dropped from the table.
`wt list --format json` includes the rendered values under `columns`.

A `Jira` column reading a key kept in git config, and a `Summary` column
showing just the first line of the git-native branch description:

```toml
[list.custom-columns.Jira]
template = "{{ git.branch.jira }}"

[list.custom-columns.Summary]
template = "{{ git.branch.description | lines | first }}"
```

### Commit

Shared by `wt step commit`, `wt step squash`, and `wt merge`.

```toml
[commit]
stage = "all"      # What to stage before commit: "all", "tracked", or "none"
```

### Merge

Most flags are on by default. Set to false to change default behavior.

```toml
[merge]
squash = true      # Squash commits into one (--no-squash to preserve history)
commit = true      # Commit uncommitted changes first (--no-commit to skip)
rebase = true      # Rebase onto target before merge (--no-rebase to skip)
remove = true      # Remove worktree after merge (--no-remove to keep)
verify = true      # Run project hooks (--no-hooks to skip)
ff = true          # Fast-forward merge (--no-ff to create a merge commit instead)
```

### Remove

Persistent flag values for `wt remove`. Override on command line as needed.

```toml
[remove]
delete-branch = true   # Delete branch after removal (--no-delete-branch to keep)
```

### Switch

```toml
[switch]
cd = true          # Change directory after switching (--no-cd to skip)

[switch.picker]
pager = "delta --paging=never"   # Example: override git's core.pager for diff preview
```

### Step

```toml
[step.copy-ignored]
exclude = []   # Additional excludes (e.g., [".cache/", ".turbo/"])
```

Built-in excludes (VCS metadata and tool-state directories) always apply; [the `wt step copy-ignored` docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/#wt-step-copy-ignored) list them. User config and project config exclusions are combined.

### Aliases

Command templates that run as `wt <name>`. See the [Extending Worktrunk guide](https://worktrunk.dev/extending/#aliases) for usage and flags.

```toml
[aliases]
greet = "echo Hello from {{ branch }}"
url = "echo http://localhost:{{ branch | hash_port }}"
```

Aliases defined here apply to all projects. For project-specific aliases, use the [project config](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#project-configuration) `[aliases]` section instead.

### User project-specific settings

User config can include a `[projects]` table for project-specific settings — worktree layout, setting overrides, anything else — separate from the [project config](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#project-configuration) shared with teammates.

Entries are keyed by project identifier — `<host>/<owner>/<repo>` derived from the primary remote URL (no `.git` suffix), or the canonical repo path when there is no remote. Run `wt config show` inside the repo to see the identifier for the current project; it appears in the `PROJECT CONFIG` section as `Identifier: …`.

Scalar values (like `worktree-path`) replace the global value; everything else (hooks, aliases, etc.) appends, global first. See [how the layers rank](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#precedence).

```toml
[projects."github.com/user/repo"]
worktree-path = ".worktrees/{{ branch | sanitize }}"
list.full = true
merge.squash = false
remove.delete-branch = false
pre-start.env = "cp .env.example .env"
step.copy-ignored.exclude = [".repo-local-cache/"]
aliases.deploy = "make deploy BRANCH={{ branch }}"
```

#### Matching several repositories with one entry

A key containing `*` matches any run of characters, `/` included, so one entry covers a whole host or namespace — including nested groups. `*` is the only wildcard; every other character, `.` among them, is literal.

```toml
# Every repository on a self-hosted forge whose hostname carries no brand
[projects."git.company.example/*"]
forge.platform = "gitlab"

# Everything under one namespace shares a layout
[projects."git.company.example/platform/*"]
worktree-path = ".worktrees/{{ branch | sanitize }}"
```

Every matching entry applies, least- to most-specific, following the rule above: a more specific entry — `git.company.example/platform/*` over `git.company.example/*` — wins where both set the same setting, while hooks and aliases from every matching entry all run, least-specific first. A literal key is the most specific of all; specificity is the count of non-`*` characters in the key. End a host-wide key with `/*` — a bare `git.company.example*` also covers hosts whose names merely start with that string.

`approved-commands` matches the same way, so a pattern entry approves its commands for every repository it covers. Only a key written by hand is ever a pattern: `wt config approvals add` and the interactive prompt record under the exact identifier, and `wt config approvals clear` removes only that exact entry, leaving a pattern other repositories share intact.

#### Forge platform and hostname

`forge` names the forge for the matched repositories — the user-level counterpart of the project config's [forge platform](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#forge-platform) block, for a self-hosted host whose name carries no `github`, `gitlab`, or `gitea` for detection to read.

```toml
[projects."git.company.example/*"]
forge.platform = "gitlab"                    # or "github", "gitea" (experimental), "azure-devops" (experimental)
forge.hostname = "api.git.company.example"   # API host, when the remote's own host isn't it
```

Both fields describe the host rather than the repository, which is why a pattern keyed to a hostname suits them, and why an SSH alias resolved through `~/.ssh/config` — where the name in the remote URL is local to one machine — belongs here rather than in a repository's committed config. A repository's own `[forge]` block still wins over any entry here, field by field: a repository that sets only `platform` still takes a matching entry's `hostname`.

Hooks support all three [hook forms](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-forms). A table runs multiple commands concurrently; an array-of-tables pipeline runs steps in sequence. The dotted-key examples below are equivalent to the table forms — TOML treats `projects."github.com/user/repo".post-start.server = "..."` and a `[projects."github.com/user/repo".post-start]` table the same way:

```toml
# Single command
[projects."github.com/user/repo"]
post-start = "mise trust"

# Multiple commands, running concurrently
[projects."github.com/user/repo".post-start]
mise = "mise trust"
server = "npm run dev"

# Pipeline: steps run in sequence
[[projects."github.com/user/repo".post-start]]
install = "npm ci"

[[projects."github.com/user/repo".post-start]]
build = "npm run build"
server = "npm run dev"
```

### Custom prompt templates

Templates use [minijinja](https://docs.rs/minijinja/) syntax.

#### Commit template

Available variables:

- `{{ git_diff }}`, `{{ git_diff_stat }}` — diff content
- `{{ branch }}`, `{{ repo }}` — context
- `{{ recent_commits }}` — recent commit messages
- `{{ user_guidance }}`, `{{ project_guidance }}` — rendered append fragments (see [Appending to the prompt](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#appending-to-the-prompt))

Default template:

<!-- DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_START -->
```toml
[commit.generation]
template = """
<task>Write a commit message for the staged changes below.</task>

<format>
- Subject line under 50 chars
- For material changes, add a blank line then a body paragraph explaining the change
- Output only the commit message, no quotes or code blocks
</format>

<style>
- Imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Match recent commit style (conventional commits if used)
- Describe the change, not the intent or benefit
</style>
{% if user_guidance %}
<user-guidance>
{{ user_guidance }}
</user-guidance>
{% endif %}{% if project_guidance %}
<project-guidance>
{{ project_guidance }}
</project-guidance>
{% endif %}
<diffstat>
{{ git_diff_stat }}
</diffstat>

<diff>
{{ git_diff }}
</diff>

<context>
Branch: {{ branch }}
{% if recent_commits %}<recent_commits>
{% for commit in recent_commits %}- {{ commit }}
{% endfor %}</recent_commits>{% endif %}
</context>

"""
```
<!-- DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_END -->

#### Squash template

Available variables (in addition to commit template variables):

- `{{ commit_details }}` — list of commits being squashed; each renders as its subject and exposes `.subject` / `.body`
- `{{ target_branch }}` — merge target branch

Default template:

<!-- DEFAULT_SQUASH_TEMPLATE_START -->
```toml
[commit.generation]
squash-template = """
<task>Write a commit message for the combined effect of these commits.</task>

<format>
- Subject line under 50 chars
- For material changes, add a blank line then a body paragraph explaining the change
- Output only the commit message, no quotes or code blocks
</format>

<style>
- Imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Match the style of commits being squashed (conventional commits if used)
- Describe the change, not the intent or benefit
</style>
{% if user_guidance %}
<user-guidance>
{{ user_guidance }}
</user-guidance>
{% endif %}{% if project_guidance %}
<project-guidance>
{{ project_guidance }}
</project-guidance>
{% endif %}
<commits branch="{{ branch }}" target="{{ target_branch }}">
{% for detail in commit_details %}- {{ detail.subject }}
{% endfor %}</commits>

<diffstat>
{{ git_diff_stat }}
</diffstat>

<diff>
{{ git_diff }}
</diff>

"""
```
<!-- DEFAULT_SQUASH_TEMPLATE_END -->

#### Appending to the prompt

`template-append` adds personal conventions to the commit and squash prompts without restating the whole template:

```toml
[commit.generation]
template-append = """
- Explain the rationale in the body, not just the change
"""
```

How the fragment renders, and the project-config counterpart: [the LLM commits guide](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/#appending-to-the-prompt).

## Hooks

See [`wt hook`](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) for hook types, execution order, template variables, and examples. User hooks apply to all projects; [project hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#project-configuration) apply only to that repository.
<!-- USER_CONFIG_END -->
<!-- PROJECT_CONFIG_START -->
# Project Configuration

Project configuration lets teams share repository-specific settings — hooks, dev server URLs, and other defaults. The file lives in `.config/wt.toml` and is typically checked into version control.

To create a starter file with commented-out examples, run `wt config create --project`.

## Hooks

Project hooks apply to this repository only. See [`wt hook`](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) for hook types, execution order, and examples.

```toml
pre-start = "npm ci"
post-start = "npm run dev"
pre-merge = "npm test"
```

## Dev server URL

URL column in `wt list` (dimmed when port not listening):

```toml
[list]
url = "http://localhost:{{ branch | hash_port }}"
```

## Forge platform

The forge is read from the remote's hostname: any host carrying `github`, `gitlab`, or `gitea` anywhere in it, plus the Azure DevOps service domains. Name the forge explicitly for a host carrying none of those, such as a Forgejo instance at `forge.example.com`:

```toml
[forge]
platform = "github"  # or "gitlab", "gitea" (experimental), "azure-devops" (experimental)
hostname = "github.example.com"  # Example: API host (GHE / self-hosted GitLab)
```

When many repositories share one self-hosted host, name it once in user config with a [pattern-keyed `[projects]` entry](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#user-project-specific-settings) instead of repeating this block in each repo. A repository's own `[forge]` still wins, field by field.

## Commit-message append

`template-append` adds project-wide conventions to the LLM commit and squash prompts, shared so every teammate's LLM sees the same style guide:

```toml
[commit.generation]
template-append = """
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, …)
- Reference the relevant issue ID in the body
"""
```

The first time the fragment is used (and whenever it changes), `wt` prompts the user to approve it — the same one-shot gate as project-defined hooks. Only `template-append` is honored from the project file; the LLM command and the main prompt template stay in [user config](https://worktrunk.dev/config/), since they describe per-developer environment (which CLI is installed, which agent the developer prefers). How the fragment renders: [the LLM commits guide](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/#appending-to-the-prompt).

## Copy-ignored excludes

Additional excludes for `wt step copy-ignored`:

```toml
[step.copy-ignored]
exclude = [".cache/", ".turbo/"]
```

Built-in excludes (VCS metadata and tool-state directories) always apply; [the `wt step copy-ignored` docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/#wt-step-copy-ignored) list them. User config and project config exclusions are combined.

## Aliases

Command templates that run as `wt <name>`. See the [Extending Worktrunk guide](https://worktrunk.dev/extending/#aliases) for usage and flags.

```toml
[aliases]
deploy = "make deploy BRANCH={{ branch }}"
url = "echo http://localhost:{{ branch | hash_port }}"
```

Aliases defined here are shared with teammates. For personal aliases, use the [user config](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#aliases) `[aliases]` section instead.
<!-- PROJECT_CONFIG_END -->

# Shell Integration

Worktrunk needs shell integration to change directories when switching worktrees. Install with:

```console
$ wt config shell install
```

For manual setup, see `wt config shell init --help`.

Without shell integration, `wt switch` prints the target directory but cannot `cd` into it.

### First-run prompts

On first run without shell integration, Worktrunk offers to install it. On first commit without LLM configuration, it offers to configure a detected tool (`claude`, `codex`). Declining sets `skip-shell-integration-prompt` or `skip-commit-generation-prompt` automatically.

# Other

## Environment variables

All user config options can be overridden with environment variables using the `WORKTRUNK_` prefix.

### Naming convention

Config keys use kebab-case (`worktree-path`), while env vars use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`WORKTRUNK_WORKTREE_PATH`). The conversion happens automatically.

For nested config sections, use double underscores to separate levels:

| Config | Environment Variable |
|--------|---------------------|
| `worktree-path` | `WORKTRUNK_WORKTREE_PATH` |
| `commit.generation.command` | `WORKTRUNK_COMMIT__GENERATION__COMMAND` |
| `commit.stage` | `WORKTRUNK_COMMIT__STAGE` |

### Example: CI/testing override

Override the LLM command in CI to use a mock:

```console
$ WORKTRUNK_COMMIT__GENERATION__COMMAND="echo 'test: automated commit'" wt merge
```

### Other environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `WORKTRUNK_BIN` | Override binary path for shell wrappers; useful for testing dev builds |
| `WORKTRUNK_CONFIG_PATH` | Override user config file location |
| `WORKTRUNK_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` | Override system config file location |
| `WORKTRUNK_PROJECT_CONFIG_PATH` | Override project config file location (defaults to `.config/wt.toml`); relative paths resolve from the worktree root |
| `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` | Colon-separated system config directories (default: `/etc/xdg`) |
| `WORKTRUNK_DIRECTIVE_CD_FILE` | Internal: set by shell wrappers. wt writes a raw path; the wrapper `cd`s to it |
| `WORKTRUNK_SHELL_CWD` | Internal: set by wt on alias and hook bodies, so a nested `wt` preserves the user's subdirectory |
| `WORKTRUNK_COMPLETE_NAME` | Internal: set by shell wrappers to the command name completions register under (defaults to the binary name) |
| `WORKTRUNK_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS` | Max parallel git commands (default: 32). Lower if hitting file descriptor limits. |
| `WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE` | Verbosity level (`0`/`1`/`2`), like `-v`/`-vv` but applied everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach |
| `RUST_LOG` | Logging directive (e.g. `worktrunk=debug`); overrides the verbosity baseline for what reaches stderr |
| `NO_COLOR` | Disable colored output ([standard](https://no-color.org/)) |
| `CLICOLOR_FORCE` | Force colored output even when not a TTY |

## Inline config overrides (`--config-set`)

`--config-set <toml>` overrides any user config key for a single invocation. The value is a TOML fragment, so arrays and tables work directly; the flag is global (works before or after the subcommand), repeatable, and a later `--config-set` replaces an earlier one for the same key.

```console
$ wt --config-set list.full=true list
$ wt step copy-ignored --config-set 'step.copy-ignored.exclude=["target", "dist"]'
```

This composes with aliases — an alias body can invoke `wt --config-set … <command>` to render a named view without changing the saved config.

## Precedence

Sources closer to the invocation rank higher (user config above system config), and within a config file a [project entry](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#user-project-specific-settings) outranks the global key of the same name. So `worktree-path` comes from the first of these that sets it:

1. `--config-set 'worktree-path = …'`
2. `WORKTRUNK_WORKTREE_PATH`
3. `[projects."github.com/owner/repo"]` in the config file
4. global `worktree-path` in the config file

A `--config-set` that names a project entry is both the highest layer and the most specific key, so it beats the same flag's global key:

```console
$ wt --config-set 'projects."github.com/owner/repo".worktree-path = "/tmp/scratch"' switch --create feature
```

Hooks, aliases and `step.copy-ignored.exclude` accumulate rather than replace, so an env-set hook and a project's hook both run.

# Subcommands

## wt config show

Show configuration files & locations.

Shows location and contents of user config (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`)
and project config (`.config/wt.toml`). Also shows system config if present.

If a config file doesn't exist, shows defaults that would be used.

### Full diagnostics

Use `--full` to run diagnostic checks:

```console
$ wt config show --full
```

This tests:
- **CI tool status** — Whether `gh` (GitHub) or `glab` (GitLab) is installed and authenticated
- **Commit generation** — Whether the LLM command can generate commit messages
- **Version check** — Whether a newer version is available on GitHub

### Command reference

```
wt config show - Show configuration files & locations

Usage: wt config show [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --full
          Run diagnostic checks (CI tools, commit generation, version)

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Output:
      --format <FORMAT>
          Output format

          logs and raw subprocess output written to .git/wt/logs/). Set WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE=0|1|2 to
          apply the same level everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach

  -y, --yes
          Skip approval prompts
```

## wt config approvals

Manage command approvals.

Project hooks and project aliases prompt for approval on first run to prevent untrusted projects from running arbitrary commands. Approvals from both flows are stored together.

### Examples

List commands and their approval status for current project:
```console
$ wt config approvals list
```

Pre-approve all hook and alias commands for current project:
```console
$ wt config approvals add
```

Pre-approve without prompting, for a container or CI job:
```console
$ wt config approvals add --yes
```

Clear approvals for current project:
```console
$ wt config approvals clear
```

Clear only approvals for commands no longer in the project config:
```console
$ wt config approvals clear --stale
```

Clear global approvals:
```console
$ wt config approvals clear --global
```

Check whether an unattended run would stop for approval:
```console
$ wt config approvals list --format=json | jq -r .state
```

### How approvals work

Approved commands are saved to `~/.config/worktrunk/approvals.toml`. Re-approval is required when the command template changes or the project moves.

`--yes` bypasses the prompt, and what it leaves behind depends on the command it is passed to. On a command that runs project commands it grants consent for that run alone and records nothing, so the next run asks again. On `wt config approvals add` the record is the whole point, so the approvals are written — which is how an unattended environment pre-approves a project it has just cloned.

### Reading approval state

`wt config approvals list` reads the state without prompting or writing it, so an orchestrator can find out whether a non-interactive run will stop for approval before scheduling one. `--format=json` emits:

```json
{
  "state": "approval_required",
  "commands": [
    {"phase": "post-start", "name": "dev", "template": "npm run dev", "approved": false},
    {"phase": "pre-merge", "template": "cargo test", "approved": true}
  ],
  "stale": ["some removed command"]
}
```

`state` is `no_commands` (the project declares none), `approval_required` (at least one is unapproved), or `approved`. `name` is absent for an unnamed command and for the commit-template fragment.

`stale` is separate rather than a fourth `state`, because it co-occurs with all three: these are approvals recorded earlier whose command has since been edited or removed from the project config. They are what `--yes` would silently re-approve, so an orchestrator preserving the approval model reads them before choosing that flag.

## wt config alias

Inspect and preview aliases.

Aliases are command templates configured in user (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`) or project (`.config/wt.toml`) config and run as `wt <name>`. See the [Extending Worktrunk guide](https://worktrunk.dev/extending/#aliases) for the configuration format.

### Examples

Show every configured alias's template:
```console
$ wt config alias show
```

Show the template for `deploy`:
```console
$ wt config alias show deploy
```

Preview an invocation without running it:
```console
$ wt config alias dry-run deploy
$ wt config alias dry-run deploy -- --env=staging
```

## wt config state

Manage internal data and cache.

State is stored in `.git/` (config entries and log files), separate from configuration files.

### Keys

- **cache**: [Regenerable caches — CI status, summaries, git commands, hints, and the `wt switch -` target](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-cache)
- **default-branch**: [The repository's default branch (`main`, `master`, etc.)](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-default-branch)
- **marker**: [Custom status marker for a branch (shown in `wt list`)](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-marker)
- **vars**: [Custom variables per branch](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-vars)
- **logs**: [Operation and debug logs](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-logs)

### Examples

Get the default branch:
```console
$ wt config state default-branch
```

Set the default branch manually:
```console
$ wt config state default-branch set main
```

Set a marker for current branch:
```console
$ wt config state marker set 🚧
```

Store arbitrary data:
```console
$ wt config state vars set env=staging
```

Drop the regenerable caches:
```console
$ wt config state cache clear
```

Show all stored state:
```console
$ wt config state get
```

Clear all stored state:
```console
$ wt config state clear
```

```

## wt config state cache

Regenerable caches.

View or drop worktrunk's regenerable caches in one place. Everything here is rebuilt on demand — clearing only forces recomputation, never data loss.

### What's cached

- **CI status** — GitHub/GitLab CI per branch (30–60s TTL), shown in [`wt list`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/#ci-status), plus the largest PR/MR number seen (sizes the CI column)
- **Summaries** — LLM-generated branch summaries (`wt list --full`, `wt switch` preview)
- **Git commands** — cached merge-tree, ancestry, diff-stat, and `wt switch` preview results
- **Hints** — one-time hints already shown in this repo
- **Previous branch** — the `wt switch -` target, re-recorded on the next switch

`cache clear` drops all of the above with no prompt. It re-shows one-time hints and forgets the `wt switch -` target until the next switch — both repopulate on their own.

Without a subcommand, runs `get`.

### Examples

Show cache contents:
```console
$ wt config state cache
```

Drop all caches:
```console
$ wt config state cache clear
```

### Command reference

          apply the same level everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach

          Skip approval prompts
```

## wt config state default-branch

Default branch detection and override.

Useful in scripts to avoid hardcoding `main` or `master`:

```console
$ git rebase $(wt config state default-branch)
```

In a hook or alias template, prefer the `{{ default_branch }}` [template variable](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#template-variables); `$(wt config state default-branch)` is for plain shell scripts.

Without a subcommand, runs `get`. `set` stores the override in the repository's local git config. The override adds no project file and applies to every linked worktree in the clone. `clear` then `get` re-detects. The branch must exist locally for `wt list` comparisons.

`default-branch get` resolves the value and caches it on a miss; the aggregate `wt config state get` only reports the cache (read-only), so it can show `(none)` until something populates it.

### Detection

Worktrunk detects the default branch automatically:

1. **Worktrunk cache** — Checks `git config worktrunk.default-branch`
2. **Git cache** — Detects primary remote and checks its HEAD (e.g., `origin/HEAD`)
3. **Remote query** — If not cached, queries `git ls-remote` — typically 100ms–2s, abandoned after 10s
4. **Local inference** — If no remote, or the query was abandoned, infers from local branches

Once detected, the result is cached in `worktrunk.default-branch` for fast access. The cache isn't re-validated on every command, so a later change to `origin/HEAD` — a renamed default branch followed by `git remote set-head origin -a` — isn't picked up automatically. `wt config state` flags the drift when the cached value differs from the remote's local HEAD — expected for a deliberate override; `set` adopts the new branch and `clear` re-detects.

An abandoned remote query is the one case that isn't cached: the branch it inferred locally answers that command, but a value guessed while the remote was unreachable would otherwise become permanent, so the next command queries again.

The local inference fallback uses these heuristics in order:
- If only one local branch exists, uses it
- For bare repos or empty repos, checks `symbolic-ref HEAD`
- Checks `git config init.defaultBranch`
- Looks for common names: `main`, `master`, `develop`, `trunk`

If none of these match, detection fails; set it explicitly with `wt config state default-branch set BRANCH`.

## wt config state logs

Operation and debug logs.

View and manage log files — hook output, command audit trail, and debug diagnostics.

### What's logged

Three kinds of logs live in `.git/wt/logs/`:

#### Command log (`commands.jsonl`)

All hook executions and LLM commands are recorded automatically — one JSON object per line. Rotates to `commands.jsonl.old` at 1MB (~2MB total). Fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ts` | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `wt` | The `wt` command that triggered this (e.g., `wt hook pre-merge --yes`) |
| `label` | What ran (e.g., `pre-merge user:lint`, `commit.generation`) |
| `cmd` | Shell command executed |
| `exit` | Exit code (`null` for background commands) |
| `dur_ms` | Duration in milliseconds (`null` for background commands) |

The command log appends entries and is not branch-specific — it records all activity across all worktrees.

#### Hook output logs

Hook output lives in per-branch subtrees under `.git/wt/logs/{branch}/`:

| Operation | Log path |
|-----------|----------|
| Background hooks | `{branch}/{source}/{hook-type}/{name}.log` |
| Background removal | `{branch}/internal/remove.log` |

All `post-*` hooks (post-start, post-switch, post-commit, post-merge) run in the background and produce log files. Source is `user` or `project`. Branch and hook names are sanitized for filesystem safety (invalid characters → `-`; short collision-avoidance hash appended). Same operation on same branch overwrites the previous log. Removing a branch clears its subtree; orphans from deleted branches can be swept with `wt config state logs clear`.

#### Diagnostic files

| File | Created when |
|------|-------------|
| `trace.log` | Running with `-vv` |
| `trace.jsonl` | Running with `-vv` |
| `subprocess.log` | Running with `-vv` |
| `diagnostic.md` | Running with `-vv` |

`trace.log` is the human-readable trace at `-vv` — each command's start (`$ …`) and completion (`✓`/`✗ … 12.3ms`), in-process spans, milestones, and bounded subprocess previews. `trace.jsonl` is the same event stream as one JSON object per line, for machines (`jq`, chrome://tracing); `wt config state logs profile` reads it to summarize a performance report (where time went, parallelism, redundant commands). `subprocess.log` holds the raw uncapped subprocess stdout/stderr bodies. `diagnostic.md` is a markdown bug-report bundle that leads with that same performance profile and inlines `trace.log`; `wt` prints a `gh gist create` command pointing at it. All four are overwritten on each `-vv` run.

### Location

All logs are stored in `.git/wt/logs/` (in the main worktree's git directory). All worktrees write to the same directory. Top-level files are shared logs (command audit + diagnostics); top-level directories are per-branch log trees.

### Structured output

`wt config state logs --format=json` emits three arrays — `command_log`, `hook_output`, `diagnostic`. Each entry carries a `file` (relative), `path` (absolute), `size`, and `modified_at` (unix seconds). Hook-output entries additionally expose `branch`, `source` (`user` / `project` / `internal`), `hook_type` (the `post-*` kind, or `null` for internal ops), and `name`. Filter with `jq` to pick out a specific entry.

### Examples

List all log files:
```console
$ wt config state logs
```

Query the command log:
```console
$ tail -5 .git/wt/logs/commands.jsonl | jq .
```

Path to one hook log (e.g. the `post-start` `server` hook for the current branch):
```console
$ wt config state logs --format=json | jq -r '.hook_output[] | select(.source == "user" and .hook_type == "post-start" and (.name | startswith("server"))) | .path'
```

Logs for a specific branch:
```console
$ wt config state logs --format=json | jq '.hook_output[] | select(.branch | startswith("feature"))'
```

Clear all logs:
```console
$ wt config state logs clear
```

## wt config state ci-status

CI status cache.

**Deprecated** — the CI status cache is now part of [`wt config state cache`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-cache). This subcommand still works but prints a deprecation notice.

Status values, display symbols, and fetch behavior: [`wt list` CI status](https://worktrunk.dev/list/#ci-status).

Without a subcommand, runs `get` for the current branch. Use `clear` to reset cache for a branch or `clear --all` to reset all.

### Command reference

```

○ Showing 4 worktrees, 2 with changes, 2 ahead, 1 column hidden
```

### Use cases

- **Work status** — `🚧` WIP, `✅` ready for review, `🔥` urgent
- **Agent tracking** — The [Claude Code](https://worktrunk.dev/claude-code/) plugin sets markers automatically
- **Notes** — Any short text: `"blocked"`, `"needs tests"`

### Storage

Stored in git config as `worktrunk.state.<branch>.marker`. Set directly with:

```console
$ git config worktrunk.state.feature.marker '{"marker":"🚧","set_at":0}'
```

Without a subcommand, runs `get` for the current branch. For `--branch`, use `get --branch=NAME`.

## wt config state vars

Custom variables per branch.

Store custom variables per branch. Values are stored as-is — plain strings or JSON.

### Examples

Set and get values:
```console
$ wt config state vars set env=staging
$ wt config state vars get env
```

Store JSON:
```console
$ wt config state vars set config='{"port": 3000, "debug": true}'
```

List all keys:
```console
$ wt config state vars list
```

Operate on a different branch:
```console
$ wt config state vars set env=production --branch=main
```

### Template access

Variables are available in [hook templates](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#template-variables) as `{{ vars.<key> }}`. Use the `default` filter for keys that may not be set:

```toml
[post-start]
dev = "ENV={{ vars.env | default('development') }} npm start -- --port {{ vars.port | default('3000') }}"
```

JSON object and array values support dot access:

```console
$ wt config state vars set config='{"port": 3000, "debug": true}'
```
```toml
[post-start]
dev = "npm start -- --port {{ vars.config.port }}"
```

### Storage format

Stored in git config as `worktrunk.state.<branch>.vars.<key>`. Keys must contain only letters, digits and hyphens — dots conflict with git config's section separator, underscores with its variable name format.

### Command reference

```

  -v, --verbose...
          Verbose output (-v: info logs + hook/alias template variables on stderr; -vv: also debug
          logs and raw subprocess output written to .git/wt/logs/). Set WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE=0|1|2 to
          apply the same level everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach

  -y, --yes
          Skip approval prompts
```
