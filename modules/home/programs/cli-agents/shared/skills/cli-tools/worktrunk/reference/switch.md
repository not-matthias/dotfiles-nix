# wt switch

Switch to a worktree; create if needed.

Worktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template. Unlike `git switch`, this navigates between worktrees rather than changing branches in place.

## Examples

```bash
$ wt switch feature-auth           # Switch to worktree
$ wt switch -                      # Previous worktree (like cd -)
$ wt switch --create new-feature   # Create new branch and worktree
$ wt switch --create hotfix --base production
$ wt switch pr:123                 # Switch to PR #123's branch
$ wt switch https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123   # ...or paste the PR's URL
```

## Creating a branch

The `--create` flag creates a new branch from `--base` — the default branch unless specified. Without `--create`, the branch must already exist. Switching to a remote branch (e.g., `wt switch feature` when only `origin/feature` exists) creates a local tracking branch.

## Creating worktrees

If the branch already has a worktree, `wt switch` changes directories to it. Otherwise, it creates one:

1. Runs [pre-switch hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types), blocking until complete
2. Creates worktree at configured path
3. Switches to new directory
4. Runs [pre-start hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types), blocking until complete
5. Spawns [post-start](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types) and [post-switch hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types) in the background

```bash
$ wt switch feature                        # Existing branch → creates worktree
$ wt switch --create feature               # New branch and worktree
$ wt switch --create fix --base release    # New branch from release
$ wt switch --create temp --no-hooks       # Skip hooks
```

## Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `^` | Default branch (`main`/`master`) |
| `@` | Current branch/worktree |
| `-` | Previous worktree (like `cd -`) |
| `pr:{N}` | GitHub PR #N's branch |
| `mr:{N}` | GitLab MR !N's branch |

```bash
$ wt switch -                           # Back to previous
$ wt switch ^                           # Default branch worktree
$ wt switch --create fix --base=@       # Branch from current HEAD
$ wt switch --create fix --base=pr:123  # Branch from PR #123's head
$ wt switch pr:123                      # PR #123's branch
$ wt switch mr:101                      # MR !101's branch
```

Shortcuts also apply to `--base`. For a fork PR/MR, the head commit is fetched and used as the base SHA without creating a tracking branch.

## Interactive picker

When called without arguments, `wt switch` opens an interactive picker to browse and select worktrees with live preview. The candidate set widens with `--branches` (local branches without worktrees), `--remotes` (remote branches), and `--prs` (open PRs/MRs — see below).

The CI column shows each row's PR/MR CI and review status, the same as [`wt list --full`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/).

**Keybindings:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` | Navigate worktree list |
| (type) | Filter worktrees |
| `Enter` | Switch to selected worktree |
| `Alt-c` | Create new worktree named as entered text |
| `Alt-x` | Remove selected worktree/branch |
| `Alt-y` | Copy selected branch name to the clipboard |
| `Alt-o` | Open the selected row's PR/MR URL in the browser |
| `Alt-r` | Refresh the list (pick up worktrees created elsewhere) |
| `Esc` | Cancel |
| `Alt-1`–`Alt-7` | Jump to a preview tab |
| `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` | Cycle preview tabs forward/backward |
| `Alt-p` | Toggle preview panel |
| `Ctrl-u`/`Ctrl-d` | Scroll preview up/down |

`Alt-o` is a no-op on a row with no PR/MR (or whose status hasn't loaded yet).

`Alt-x` is a no-op on the current worktree (the `@` row) — removing the worktree in use would have to switch elsewhere first, so switch away and remove it from there.

Each row filters by its branch, path, and — when it has a PR/MR — the PR/MR's number, title, and author, the same fields whether the PR is checked out (a worktree row) or listed via `--prs`. Plain digits go to the filter, so a number can be typed directly and the preview tabs move to `Alt`.

Typing a gutter sigil filters by row kind: `+` narrows to linked worktrees and `@` to the current worktree. The other sigils don't filter cleanly — `^` and `|` are skim's prefix-anchor and OR query operators (so `^` matches every row and `|` none), and `/` matches most rows because every worktree path contains it.

**Preview tabs:**

1. **HEAD±** — Diff of uncommitted changes
2. **log** — Recent commits; commits already on the default branch have dimmed hashes
3. **main…±** — Diff of changes since the merge-base with the default branch
4. **remote⇅** — Ahead/behind diff vs upstream tracking branch
5. **summary** — LLM-generated branch summary; requires `[list] summary = true` and [`commit.generation`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#commit)
6. **pr** — The selected row's PR/MR, for any row whose branch has one
7. **comments** — The PR/MR's comment thread, fetched from the forge on `--prs` rows

On narrow previews the tab bar compacts to digits — only the active tab keeps its label — so every `Alt-N` accelerator stays visible.

**Pager configuration:** The preview panel pipes diff output through git's pager. Override in user config:

```toml
[switch.picker]
pager = "delta --paging=never --width=$COLUMNS"
```

## Pull requests and merge requests

The `pr:<number>` / `mr:<number>` shortcut and the PR/MR's web URL both resolve to its branch. For same-repo PRs/MRs, worktrunk switches to the branch directly. For fork PRs/MRs, it fetches the ref (`refs/pull/N/head` or `refs/merge-requests/N/head`) and configures `pushRemote` to the fork URL.

```bash
$ wt switch pr:101                                  # GitHub PR #101
$ wt switch https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/101  # ...the same PR, by URL
$ wt switch mr:101                                  # GitLab MR !101
$ wt switch https://gitlab.com/owner/repo/-/merge_requests/101  # ...the same MR, by URL
$ wt switch --prs                                   # Browse open PRs/MRs in the picker
```

Both work anywhere a branch is accepted, including `--base`. The `--create` flag cannot be used with a PR/MR reference since the branch already exists.

If the PR or MR is on a fork, the local branch uses its branch name directly, so `git push` works normally. A pre-existing local branch with that name tracking something else requires renaming first.

The `--prs` flag adds the repository's open PRs (GitHub) or MRs (GitLab) to the interactive picker — only the ones not already there: a PR whose branch is already shown (as a worktree, or a local or remote branch) isn't listed twice, so `--prs` only adds the rest and the two pickers differ solely by those extra rows. Each added row resolves to the same `pr:`/`mr:` shortcut, so selecting one fetches the ref and switches to its branch. A `--prs` row has no local worktree, so its `pr` and `comments` preview tabs load the PR/MR's metadata and comments from the forge in the background. The `log` tab uses a local `git log` — graph and merge-base dimming included — whenever the head commit is already in the object store (a same-repo PR off a fetched remote), falling back to a flat forge-fetched commit list otherwise.

Requires `gh` (GitHub), `glab` (GitLab), or an equivalent CLI installed and authenticated; see [forge platform](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#forge-platform) for Gitea, Azure DevOps, and other supported platforms.

## When wt switch fails

- **Branch doesn't exist** — Use `--create`, or check `wt list --branches`
- **Path occupied** — Another worktree is at the target path; switch to it or remove it
- **Stale directory** — Use `--clobber` to remove a non-worktree directory at the target path

To change which branch a worktree is on, use `git switch` inside that worktree.

## Command reference

```
wt switch - Switch to a worktree; create if needed

Usage: wt switch [OPTIONS] [BRANCH] [-- <EXECUTE_ARGS>...]

Arguments:
  [BRANCH]
          Branch name, shortcut, or PR/MR URL

          Opens interactive picker if omitted. Shortcuts: ^ (default branch), - (previous), @
          (current), pr:{N} (GitHub PR), mr:{N} (GitLab MR)

  [EXECUTE_ARGS]...
          Additional arguments for --execute command (after --)

          Arguments after -- are appended to the execute command. Each argument is expanded for
          templates, then POSIX shell-escaped.

Options:
  -c, --create
          Create a new branch

  -b, --base <BASE>
          Base branch

          Defaults to default branch. Supports the same shortcuts as the branch argument: ^, @, -,
          pr:{N}, mr:{N}.

  -x, --execute <EXECUTE>
          Command to run after switch

          Replaces the wt process with the command after switching, giving it full terminal control.
          Useful for launching editors, AI agents, or other interactive tools.

          Without a branch argument, the interactive picker opens and the command runs against the
          selected worktree — so wt switch -x claude picks a worktree, then launches Claude Code
          there.

          Supports hook template variables ({{ branch }}, {{ worktree_path }}, etc.) and filters. {{
          base }} and {{ base_worktree_path }} require --create.

          Especially useful with shell aliases:

            alias wsc='wt switch --create -x claude'
            wsc feature-branch -- 'Fix GH #322'

          Then wsc feature-branch creates the worktree and launches Claude Code. Arguments after --
          are passed to the command, so wsc feature -- 'Fix GH #322' runs claude 'Fix GH #322',
          starting Claude with a prompt.

          Template example: -x code -- '{{ worktree_path }}' opens VS Code at the worktree, -x tmux
          -- new -s '{{ branch | sanitize }}' starts a tmux session named after the branch.

      --clobber
          Remove stale paths at target

      --no-cd
          Skip directory change after switching

          Hooks still run normally. Useful when hooks handle navigation (e.g., tmux workflows) or
          for CI/automation. Use --cd to override.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Picker Options:
      --branches
          Include branches without worktrees

      --remotes
          Include remote branches

      --prs
          Include open PRs/MRs

Automation:
      --no-hooks
          Skip hooks

      --format <FORMAT>
          Output format

          JSON prints structured result to stdout. Designed for tool integration (e.g., Claude Code
          WorktreeCreate hooks).

          [default: text]
          [possible values: text, json]

Global Options:
  -C <path>
          Working directory for this command

      --config <path>
          User config file path

      --config-set <toml>
          Override config with inline TOML, e.g. --config-set list.full=true (repeatable)

  -v, --verbose...
          Verbose output (-v: info logs + hook/alias template variables on stderr; -vv: also debug
          logs and raw subprocess output written to .git/wt/logs/). Set WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE=0|1|2 to
          apply the same level everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach

  -y, --yes
          Skip approval prompts
```
