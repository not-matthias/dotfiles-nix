# wt step

Run individual operations. The building blocks of wt merge — commit, squash, rebase, push — plus standalone utilities.

## Examples

Commit with LLM-generated message:

```

# Subcommands

## wt step commit

Stage and commit with LLM-generated message.

See [LLM-generated commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/) for configuration and prompt customization.

### Options

#### Staging

Controls what to stage before committing:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `all` | Stage all changes including untracked files (default) |
| `tracked` | Stage only modified tracked files |
| `none` | Don't stage anything, commit only what's already staged |

```bash
$ wt step commit --stage=tracked
```

Configure the default in user config:

```toml
[commit]
stage = "tracked"
```

#### Dry run

Render the prompt, print the LLM command, generate the message, and exit without staging, running hooks, or committing:

```bash
$ wt step commit --dry-run
```

Three sections are printed: the rendered prompt, the shell command that would invoke the LLM, and the message returned. The LLM call still happens — only the commit is skipped.

          Skip approval prompts
```

## wt step diff

Show all changes since branching. Includes committed, staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

This is what `wt merge` would include — a single diff against the merge base.

### Operating on another worktree

`--branch` diffs another worktree's branch without leaving the current one:

```bash
$ wt step diff --branch feature
```

The branch must have a checked-out worktree.

### Extra git diff arguments

Arguments after `--` are forwarded to `git diff`:

```bash
$ wt step diff -- --stat
$ wt step diff -- --name-only
$ wt step diff -- -- '*.rs'
```

The diff is pipeable to tools like `delta`:

```bash
$ wt step diff | delta
```

### How it works

Equivalent to:

```bash
$ cp "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/index" /tmp/idx
$ GIT_INDEX_FILE=/tmp/idx git add --intent-to-add .
$ GIT_INDEX_FILE=/tmp/idx git diff $(git merge-base HEAD $(wt config state default-branch))
```

`git diff` ignores untracked files. `git add --intent-to-add .` registers them in the index without staging their content, making them visible to `git diff`. This runs against a copy of the real index so the original is never modified.

          apply the same level everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach

  -y, --yes
          Skip approval prompts
```

## wt step copy-ignored

Copy gitignored files to another worktree. Eliminates cold starts by copying build caches and dependencies.

### Setup

Add to the project config:

```toml
# .config/wt.toml
[post-start]
copy = "wt step copy-ignored"
```

### What gets copied

All gitignored files are copied by default, except for built-in excluded directories: VCS metadata (`.bzr/`, `.hg/`, `.jj/`, `.pijul/`, `.sl/`, `.svn/`), tool-state (`.conductor/`, `.entire/`, `.worktrees/`), and nested worktrees. Tracked files are never touched. Discovery handles nested `.gitignore` files, global excludes, and `.git/info/exclude`. Existing files in the destination are skipped, so re-running is safe; `--force` overwrites them.

To limit what gets copied further, create `.worktreeinclude` with gitignore-style patterns. Files must be **both** gitignored **and** in `.worktreeinclude`:

```text
# .worktreeinclude
.env
node_modules/
target/
```

After `.worktreeinclude` selects entries, you can add more gitignore-style excludes in user config, per-project user overrides, or project config:

```toml
[step.copy-ignored]
exclude = [".cache/", ".turbo/"]
```

To copy nothing unless `.worktreeinclude` exists — matching Claude Code desktop, where the file is required — pass `--require-include`:

```bash
wt step copy-ignored --require-include
```

Without `.worktreeinclude`, the command is a no-op (it reports that nothing was copied and why). With the file present, only matching files copy as above. To apply this across every repository, put the flag in a user-config hook: `post-start = "wt step copy-ignored --require-include"`.

### Common patterns

| Type | Patterns |
|------|----------|
| Dependencies | `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `Pods/` |
| Build caches | `.cache/`, `.next/`, `.parcel-cache/`, `.turbo/` |
| Generated assets | Images, ML models, binaries too large for git |
| Environment files | `.env` (if not generated per-worktree) |

### Performance

Reflink copies share disk blocks until modified — no data is actually copied. For a 14GB `target/` directory:

| Command | Time |
|---------|------|
| `cp -R` (full copy) | 2m |
| `cp -Rc` / `wt step copy-ignored` | 20s |

Uses per-file reflink (like `cp -Rc`) — copy time scales with file count.

Use the `post-start` hook so the copy runs in the background. Use `pre-start` instead if subsequent hooks or `--execute` command need the copied files immediately.

### Background-hook priority (experimental)

When invoked from a background hook pipeline (`post-*` hooks), `wt step copy-ignored` self-lowers its CPU and I/O priority — `taskpolicy -b` on macOS, `nice -n 19` plus `ionice -c 3` on Linux — so it yields to interactive work. Foreground callers (`pre-*` hooks, direct interactive use) run at normal priority so the user isn't waiting on a throttled copy.

wt signals background-hook context by exporting `WORKTRUNK_FOREGROUND=-1` into every detached hook pipeline; `copy-ignored` inspects that variable on entry. The variable name is experimental and may change.

### Language-specific notes

#### Rust

The `target/` directory is huge (often 1-10GB). Copying with reflink cuts first build from ~68s to ~3s by reusing compiled dependencies.

#### Node.js

`node_modules/` is large but mostly static. If the project has no native dependencies, symlinks are even faster:

```toml
[pre-start]
deps = "ln -sf {{ primary_worktree_path }}/node_modules ."
```

#### Python

Virtual environments contain absolute paths and can't be copied. Use `uv sync` instead — it's fast enough that copying isn't worth it.

### Behavior vs Claude Code on desktop

The `.worktreeinclude` pattern is shared with [Claude Code on desktop](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop), which copies matching files when creating worktrees. Differences:

- worktrunk copies all gitignored files by default; Claude Code requires `.worktreeinclude`. Pass `--require-include` to match Claude Code (copy nothing without `.worktreeinclude`)
- worktrunk uses copy-on-write for large directories like `target/` (see Performance above)
- worktrunk runs as a configurable hook in the worktree lifecycle

## wt step eval

[experimental]

Evaluate a template expression. Prints the result to stdout for use in scripts and shell substitutions.

All [hook template variables and filters](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#template-variables) are available.

### Examples

Get the port for the current branch:

```bash
$ wt step eval '{{ branch | hash_port }}'
16066
```

Use in shell substitution:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:$(wt step eval '{{ branch | hash_port }}')/health
```

Combine multiple values:

```bash
$ wt step eval '{{ branch | hash_port }},{{ ("supabase-api-" ~ branch) | hash_port }}'
16066,16739
```

Use conditionals and filters:

```bash
$ wt step eval '{{ branch | sanitize_db }}'
feature_auth_oauth2_a1b
```

List the available template variables with `-v` (alongside the expansion, on stderr):

```bash
$ wt step eval -v '{{ branch }}'
○ eval template variables:
  branch        = feature/auth-oauth2
  worktree_path = /home/user/projects/myapp-feature-auth-oauth2
○ eval source
  {{ branch }}
○ eval result
  feature/auth-oauth2

Arguments:
  <TEMPLATE>
          Template expression to evaluate

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Automation:
      --format <FORMAT>
          Output format

          JSON prints {name, template, result} to stdout instead of the bare result.

          [default: text]
          [possible values: text, json]

Global Options:
  -C <path>
          Working directory for this command

      --config <path>
          User config file path

      --config-set <toml>
          Override config with inline TOML, e.g. --config-set list.full=true (repeatable)

  -v, --verbose...
          Verbose output (-v: info logs + hook/alias template variables on stderr; -vv: also debug
          logs and raw subprocess output written to .git/wt/logs/). Set WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE=0|1|2 to
          apply the same level everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach

  -y, --yes
          Skip approval prompts
```

## wt step for-each

[experimental]

Run command in each worktree. Executes sequentially with real-time output; continues past command failures.

A summary of successes and failures is shown at the end. A template-expansion error (a malformed `{{ … }}` argument) aborts the whole run; only command failures are tolerated and reported. Context JSON — a flat object of every template variable — is piped to stdin for scripts that need structured data.

### Arguments

Arguments after `--` are the program and its arguments — run directly, no shell.

```bash
$ wt step for-each -- git status --short
$ wt step for-each -- npm install
```

For pipes, redirects, variables, or globs, wrap in `sh -c`:

```bash
$ wt step for-each -- sh -c 'git status | wc -l'
$ wt step for-each -- sh -c 'echo $HOME && git pull'
```

### Template variables

Variables substitute into each argv element before exec. See [`wt hook` template variables](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#template-variables) for the complete list and filters.

```bash
$ wt step for-each -- echo 'Branch: {{ branch }}'
```

Each element is expanded fresh in every worktree, so `{{ branch }}` is that worktree's branch. An alias wrapping for-each renders templates earlier, in the invoking worktree; [deferring expansion in an alias](https://worktrunk.dev/extending/#deferring-expansion-to-a-nested-wt-command) shows how to keep a variable per-worktree.

### Examples

Pull updates in worktrees with upstreams (skips others):

```bash
$ git fetch --prune && wt step for-each -- sh -c '[ "$(git rev-parse @{u} 2>/dev/null)" ] || exit 0; git pull --autostash'
```

### Command reference

```
wt step for-each - [experimental] Run command in each worktree

Executes sequentially with real-time output; continues past command failures.

Usage: wt step for-each [OPTIONS] -- <ARGS>...

Arguments:
  <ARGS>...
          Command template (see --help for all variables)

Options:
      --format <FORMAT>
          Output format

          [default: text]
          [possible values: text, json]

      --config-set <toml>
          Override config with inline TOML, e.g. --config-set list.full=true (repeatable)

  -v, --verbose...
          Verbose output (-v: info logs + hook/alias template variables on stderr; -vv: also debug
          logs and raw subprocess output written to .git/wt/logs/). Set WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE=0|1|2 to
          apply the same level everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach

  -y, --yes
          Skip approval prompts
```

## wt step promote

[experimental]

Swap a branch into the main worktree. Exchanges branches and gitignored files between two worktrees.

**Experimental.** Use promote for temporary testing when the main worktree has special significance (Docker Compose, IDE configs, heavy build artifacts anchored to project root), and hooks & tools aren't yet set up to run on arbitrary worktrees. The idiomatic Worktrunk workflow does not use `promote`; instead each worktree has a full environment. `promote` is the only Worktrunk command which changes a branch in an existing worktree.

### Example

```bash
# from ~/project (main worktree)
$ wt step promote feature
```

Before:

```
  Branch   Path
@ main     ~/project
+ feature  ~/project.feature
```

After:

```
  Branch   Path
@ feature  ~/project
+ main     ~/project.feature
```

To restore: `wt step promote main` from anywhere, or just `wt step promote` from the main worktree.

Without an argument, promotes the current branch — or restores the default branch if run from the main worktree.

### Requirements

- Both worktrees must be clean
- The branch must have an existing worktree

### Gitignored files

Gitignored files (build artifacts, `node_modules/`, `.env`) are swapped along with the branches so each worktree keeps the artifacts that belong to its branch. Files are discovered using the same mechanism as [`copy-ignored`](#wt-step-copy-ignored) and can be filtered with `.worktreeinclude`.

The swap uses `rename()` for each entry — fast regardless of entry size, since only filesystem metadata changes. If the worktree is on a different filesystem from `.git/`, it falls back to reflink copy.

### Command reference

```
wt step promote - [experimental] Swap a branch into the main worktree

Exchanges branches and gitignored files between two worktrees.

Usage: wt step promote [OPTIONS] [BRANCH]

Arguments:
  [BRANCH]
          Branch to promote to main worktree

          Defaults to current branch, or default branch from main worktree.

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Automation:
      --format <FORMAT>
          Output format

          JSON prints structured result to stdout after the promote completes. The mismatch warning
          still appears on stderr in JSON mode (safety signal).

          [default: text]
          [possible values: text, json]

Global Options:
  -C <path>
          Working directory for this command

      --config <path>
          User config file path

      --config-set <toml>
          Override config with inline TOML, e.g. --config-set list.full=true (repeatable)

  -v, --verbose...
          Verbose output (-v: info logs + hook/alias template variables on stderr; -vv: also debug
          logs and raw subprocess output written to .git/wt/logs/). Set WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE=0|1|2 to
          apply the same level everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach

  -y, --yes
          Skip approval prompts
```

## wt step prune

[experimental]

Remove worktrees merged into the default branch.

Bulk-removes worktrees and branches that are integrated into the default branch, using the same criteria as `wt remove`'s branch cleanup. Stale worktree entries are cleaned up too.

In `wt list`, candidates show `_` (same commit) or `⊂` (content integrated). Run `--dry-run` to preview. See `wt remove --help` for the full integration criteria.

Locked worktrees and the main worktree are always skipped. The current worktree is removed last, triggering cd to the primary worktree. Pre-remove and post-remove hooks run for each removal; a candidate whose hooks include an unapproved project command is skipped with `(approval required)` (pre-approve with `wt config approvals add`, or pass `--yes`).

### Min-age guard

Worktrees younger than `--min-age` (default: 1 day) are skipped. This prevents removing a worktree just created from the default branch — it looks "merged" because its branch points at the same commit.

```bash
$ wt step prune --min-age=0s     # no age guard
$ wt step prune --min-age=2d     # skip worktrees younger than 2 days
```

## wt step relocate

[experimental]

Move worktrees to expected paths. Relocates worktrees whose path doesn't match the worktree-path template.

### Examples

Preview what would be moved:

```bash
$ wt step relocate --dry-run
```

Move all mismatched worktrees:

```bash
$ wt step relocate
```

Auto-commit and clobber blockers (never fails):

```bash
$ wt step relocate --commit --clobber
```

Move specific worktrees:

```bash
$ wt step relocate feature bugfix
```

### Swap handling

When worktrees are at each other's expected locations (e.g., `alpha` at
`repo.beta` and `beta` at `repo.alpha`), relocate automatically resolves
this by using a temporary location.

### Clobbering

With `--clobber`, non-worktree paths at target locations are moved to
`<path>.bak.<timestamp>` before relocating. If that name is already taken,
the move counts up (`…-2`, `…-3`, …) until it finds a free name, so an
existing backup is never overwritten.

### Main worktree behavior

The main worktree can't be moved with `git worktree move`. Instead, relocate
switches it to the default branch and creates a new linked worktree at the
expected path. Untracked and gitignored files remain at the original location.

### Dirty worktrees

Linked worktrees relocate as-is — `git worktree move` carries uncommitted
changes along. Only the main worktree skips when dirty (its `git checkout`
refuses), unless `--commit` is passed.

### Skipped worktrees

- **Dirty main worktree** (without `--commit`) — use `--commit` to auto-commit first
- **Locked** — unlock with `git worktree unlock`
- **Target blocked** (without `--clobber`) — use `--clobber` to backup blocker
- **Detached HEAD** — no branch to compute expected path

### Command reference

```
wt step relocate - [experimental] Move worktrees to expected paths

Relocates worktrees whose path doesn't match the worktree-path template.

Usage: wt step relocate [OPTIONS] [BRANCHES]...

Arguments:

      --clobber
          Backup non-worktree paths at target locations

          Moves blocking paths to <path>.bak.<timestamp>. If that name is taken, counts up (…-2, …-3
          , …) to a free name.

## wt step tether

[experimental]

Run a command; kill its whole process tree when its worktree is removed. Teardown is automatic and needs no pre-remove hook; the group gets SIGTERM then SIGKILL.

### Why

A `post-start` hook to start a long-lived process and a `pre-remove` hook to
stop it is usually enough. But `pre-remove` only runs when worktrunk removes
the worktree, so a `git worktree remove`, an `rm -rf`, or a crashed hook skips
it. Across enough worktree churn some process is bound to outlive its worktree,
and with no cleanup these leaks accumulate (on macOS they eventually saturate
`fseventsd`). `tether` removes the need for a `pre-remove`: it ties the
command's lifetime to the worktree and kills the whole process group once the
worktree is gone.

### Arguments

Arguments after `--` are the program and its arguments, run directly, no shell.

```bash
$ wt step tether -- npm run dev
```

For pipes, redirects, variables, or globs, wrap in `sh -c`:

```bash
$ wt step tether -- sh -c 'PORT=$P npm run dev | tee dev.log'
```

To run the command from a subdirectory, pass the global `-C` flag (teardown
still watches the worktree root, so a server launched with a relative `-C` is
torn down with the worktree):

```bash
$ wt step tether -C frontend -- npm run dev
```

### Examples

Run a dev server, torn down automatically when the worktree goes away:

```toml
# .config/wt.toml
[post-start]
server = "wt step tether -- npm run dev -- --port {{ branch | hash_port }}"
```

### Command reference
