> **September 2026**: Worktrunk was [released](https://x.com/max_sixty/status/2006077845391724739?s=20) at the start of the year, and has quickly become the most popular git worktree manager. It's built with love (there's no slop!). Please let me know any frictions at all; I'm intensely focused on continuing to make Worktrunk excellent, and the biggest help is folks posting problems they perceive.

Worktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for running AI agents in parallel.

Worktrunk's three core commands make worktrees as easy as branches. Plus, Worktrunk has a bunch of quality-of-life features to simplify working with many parallel changes, including hooks to automate local workflows.

A quick demo:

## Context: git worktrees

AI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without
supervision, such that it's possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git's native
worktree feature give each agent its own working directory, so they don't step
on each other's changes.

But the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as small as starting a new
worktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat
../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.

## Worktrunk makes git worktrees as easy as branches

Worktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template. Commands that take a branch also accept the path of the worktree it is checked out in.

- **[Hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge, etc
- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs
- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command
- **[Interactive picker](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/#interactive-picker)** — browse worktrees with live diff and log previews

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS & Linux):**

```bash
brew install worktrunk && wt config shell install
```

Shell integration allows commands to change directories.

**Cargo:**

```bash
cargo install worktrunk && wt config shell install
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows & other</strong></summary>

**Windows.** `wt` defaults to Windows Terminal's command, so Winget additionally installs Worktrunk as `git-wt` to avoid the conflict:

```bash
winget install max-sixty.worktrunk
git-wt config shell install
```

Alternatively, disable Windows Terminal's alias (Settings → Apps → Advanced app settings → App execution aliases → "Terminal"/"Terminal Preview") to use `wt` directly.

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S worktrunk && wt config shell install
```

**Conda / Pixi** (community-maintained [feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/worktrunk-feedstock)):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge worktrunk && wt config shell install
```

Or with [Pixi](https://pixi.sh): `pixi global install worktrunk && wt config shell install`.

</details>

## Quick start

Create a worktree for a new feature:

```console
$ wt switch --create feature-auth
✓ Created branch feature-auth from main and worktree @ ~/repo.feature-auth
```

This creates a new branch and worktree, then switches to it. Do your work, then check all worktrees with [`wt list`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/):

```console
$ wt list
  Branch        Status        HEAD±    main↕     main…±  Remote⇅  Commit   Age   Message
@ feature-auth  +   ↑      +27   -8   ↑1       +31                4bc72dc  2h    Add authenticati…
^ main              ^⇡                                    ⇡1      0e631ad  1d    Initial commit

○ Showing 2 worktrees, 1 with changes, 1 ahead, 1 column hidden
```

The `@` marks the current worktree. `+` means staged changes, `↑1` means 1 commit ahead of main, `⇡` means unpushed commits.

When done, either:

**PR workflow** — commit, push, open a PR, merge via GitHub/GitLab, then clean up:

```bash
wt step commit                    # commit staged changes
gh pr create                      # or glab mr create
wt remove                         # after PR is merged
```

**Local merge** — squash, rebase onto main, fast-forward merge, clean up:

```console
$ wt merge main
◎ Generating commit message and committing changes... (2 files, +53, no squashing needed)
  Add authentication module
✓ Committed changes @ a1b2c3d
◎ Merging 1 commit to main @ a1b2c3d (no rebase needed)
  * a1b2c3d Add authentication module
   auth.rs | 51 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   lib.rs  |  2 ++
   2 files changed, 53 insertions(+)
✓ Merged to main (1 commit, 2 files, +53)
◎ Removing feature-auth worktree & branch in background (same commit as main, _)
○ Switched to worktree for main @ ~/repo
```

For parallel agents, create multiple worktrees and launch an agent in each:

```bash
wt switch -x claude -c feature-a -- 'Add user authentication'
wt switch -x claude -c feature-b -- 'Fix the pagination bug'
wt switch -x claude -c feature-c -- 'Write tests for the API'
```

The `-x` flag runs a command after switching; arguments after `--` are passed to it. Configure [post-start hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types) to automate setup (install deps, start dev servers).

### Star history

<!-- `sealed_token` is a GitHub token of ours encrypted with star-history's public
     key, from "Generate embed code" on star-history.com. Without one the chart
     renders a "GitHub restricted access to star data" placeholder: GitHub limits
     stargazer data to a repo's admins and collaborators, and their servers are
     neither.

     The token is fine-grained and reaches only this repo. Its Contents permission
     has to be read *and write* — write access is what GitHub accepts as proof of
     collaborator status, so rotating to a read-only token brings the placeholder
     straight back. Publishing the ciphertext is safe on its own; what the scope
     buys is a bound on star-history, which decrypts it and so holds a credential
     that can push here until it expires 2027-08-16 — at which point the chart
     reverts to the placeholder with nothing else to signal it. star-history
     reports GitHub is working on restoring access, so drop this parameter once
     the plain URL renders a chart again. -->
