# pi-hashline-edit

A [pi-coding-agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent) extension that replaces the built-in `read` and `edit` tools with a hash-anchored line-editing workflow.

Every line returned by `read` carries a short content hash. Edits reference these hashes instead of raw text, so the tool can detect stale context and reject outdated changes before they reach the file.

Inspired by [oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi).

## Installation

```bash
# From npm
pi install npm:pi-hashline-edit

# From a local checkout
pi install /path/to/pi-hashline-edit
```

## How It Works

### `read` — tagged line output

Text files are returned with a `LINE#HASH:` prefix on every line. Line numbers may be left-padded within each returned block so the `#HASH:` columns align:

```text
 8#VR:function hello() {
 9#KT:  console.log("world");
10#BH:}
```

- `LINE` — 1-indexed line number.
- `HASH` — 2-character content hash from the alphabet `ZPMQVRWSNKTXJBYH`.

Optional parameters:
- `offset` — start reading from this line number (1-indexed).
- `limit` — maximum number of lines to return.

Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) are passed through as attachments and do not participate in the hashline protocol. Binary and directory paths are rejected with a descriptive error. Empty files return an advisory suggesting `prepend`/`append` instead of a synthetic anchor.

### `edit` — hash-anchored modifications

Edits use the `LINE#HASH` anchors from `read` output to target lines precisely:

```json
{
  "path": "src/main.ts",
  "edits": [
    { "op": "replace", "pos": "11#KT", "lines": ["  console.log('hashline');"] }
  ]
}
```

| Op | Purpose | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `replace` | Replace one line (`pos`) or an inclusive range (`pos` + `end`). | `pos` required, `end` optional, `lines` |
| `append` | Insert lines after `pos`. Omit `pos` to append at EOF. | `pos` optional, `lines` |
| `prepend` | Insert lines before `pos`. Omit `pos` to prepend at BOF. | `pos` optional, `lines` |
| `replace_text` | Replace an exact unique substring anywhere in the file. Fails if the text is not found or matches more than once. | `oldText`, `newText` |

All edits in a single call validate against the same pre-edit snapshot and apply bottom-up, so line numbers stay consistent across operations.

### Chained edits

After a successful edit, the result includes an `--- Updated anchors ---` block with fresh `LINE#HASH` references for the changed region. These can be used directly in the next `edit` call on the same file without a full re-read, provided the next edit targets the same or nearby lines. For distant changes, use `read` first.

### Diff preview

Each edit result includes a compact `Diff preview:` block showing the changed lines with `+`/`-` markers and their new `LINE#HASH` anchors, making quick follow-up edits possible without a full re-read.

## Design Decisions

- **Stale anchors fail.** A hash mismatch means the file has changed since the last `read`. The error includes a snippet with fresh `LINE#HASH` references for the affected lines for immediate retry.
- **No fallback relocation.** Mismatched anchors are never silently relocated to a "close enough" line. This trades convenience for correctness.
- **Strict patch content.** If `lines` contains `LINE#HASH:` display prefixes or diff `+`/`-` markers, the edit is rejected with `[E_INVALID_PATCH]`. The model must send literal file content; the runtime does not silently strip accidental prefixes.
- **Hidden legacy compatibility.** When a caller sends a top-level `oldText`/`newText` payload (the built-in edit format), the tool attempts an exact unique match. Usage is surfaced to the interactive UI so the operator can see that the model isn't using hashline mode.
- **Atomic writes.** Files are written via temp-file-then-rename to avoid corruption from interrupted writes. Symlink chains are resolved so the target file is updated without replacing the symlink. Hard-linked files are updated in place to preserve the shared inode. File permissions are preserved across atomic renames.
- **Per-file mutation queue.** Edits queue by the canonical write target, so concurrent edits through different symlink paths still serialize onto the same underlying file.

## Hashing

Hashes are computed with [xxhashjs](https://github.com/pierrec/js-xxhash) (xxHash32), then mapped to a 2-character string from a custom 16-character alphabet.

The alphabet (`ZPMQVRWSNKTXJBYH`) excludes hex digits, common vowels, and visually ambiguous letters (D/G/I/L/O), so a reference like `5#MQ` can never be confused with code content, hex literals, or English words.

Lines that contain no alphanumeric characters (e.g. a lone `}`) use their line number as the hash seed to reduce collisions on structurally identical markers.

## Development

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Set `PI_HASHLINE_DEBUG=1` to show an "active" notification at session start.
