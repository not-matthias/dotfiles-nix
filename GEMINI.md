# Gemini Code Assistant Report

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `dotfiles-nix` repository, outlining its structure, conventions, and key components. The information herein is intended to guide developers in understanding, navigating, and contributing to the project.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive NixOS configuration managed with Nix Flakes. It is designed to be modular and reusable across multiple hosts, with a clear separation of concerns between system-level configurations, user-specific settings (managed via `home-manager`), and hardware-specific details. The project also leverages overlays to customize and extend the Nixpkgs package set.

## File Structure

The repository is organized into the following key directories:

-   `hosts/`: Contains the main NixOS configurations for each individual host (e.g., `desktop`, `laptop`). Each host directory includes a `default.nix` that imports the necessary modules and a `hardware-configuration.nix` specific to that machine.
-   `modules/`: This directory is the core of the reusable configuration, divided into:
    -   `home/`: Contains `home-manager` configurations for user-specific packages and dotfiles, such as shells, editors, and themes.
    -   `system/`: Holds system-level configurations that can be shared across different hosts, such as services, hardware settings, and virtualization options.
    -   `overlays/`: Provides custom packages and modifications to existing Nix packages.
-   `pkgs/`: Contains custom package definitions that are not part of the official Nixpkgs repository.
-   `secrets/`: Manages sensitive data using `agenix`, with secrets encrypted for security.
-   `flake.nix`: The entry point for the Nix Flake, defining the project's inputs (dependencies) and outputs (NixOS and home-manager configurations).

## Conventions

The repository follows several conventions to maintain consistency and clarity:

-   **Modularity**: Configurations are broken down into small, reusable modules that are imported where needed. This makes the codebase easier to manage and understand.
-   **Separation of Concerns**: There is a clear distinction between system-level configuration (`modules/system/`), user-specific configuration (`modules/home/`), and host-specific configuration (`hosts/`).
-   **Flakes**: The project is built around Nix Flakes, which provides a reproducible and declarative way to manage dependencies and build outputs.
-   **Secrets Management**: Sensitive information is managed using `agenix`, ensuring that secrets are not stored in plain text in the repository.
-   **User-Specific Naming**: The `user` variable is consistently used throughout the codebase to refer to the primary user, making it easy to adapt the configuration for different users.

## Key Technologies

-   **NixOS**: The declarative Linux distribution that underpins the entire configuration.
-   **Nix Flakes**: The dependency management and build system used to ensure reproducibility.
-   **Home Manager**: Manages user-specific dotfiles and packages.
-   **Agenix**: Used for managing secrets and sensitive information.
-   **devenv**: Provides a seamless development environment for working on the repository.

## Scripts and Commands

The `README.md` file provides a good overview of the most common commands used in this repository. Here are some of the key commands:

-   **Installation**: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<hostname>`
-   **Upgrade**: `nix flake update`
-   **Garbage Collection**: `nix-collect-garbage -d`
-   **Secrets Management**: `agenix -e <secret-name>.age`
